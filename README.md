# **Zaku²** Case for DIY Slime VR

<img src="Assets/zakulogo.png" width="300">

## The Zaku² case is one of the smallest cases ever designed for DIY Slime VR

<img src="Assets/Main.png" height="250" style="display:block;margin:15px auto">

All the parts were designed with FDM 3D-Printing in mind, without requiring any printing support.
The case has a snap-fitting lid design that snaps into place without the need for any screws or adhesive.
The case currently supports two types of batteries, and a single IMU type at the moment.
(Support for different IMUs and extensions is in the works)

Ideally, you should mix between soldering under, and over the tray while making use of the cutout on the tray to clean up and tuck any extra wiring. Another not recommended, but challenging method, especially for beginners is to hide all the wiring under the tray and go for a complete "clean look" with all the wires hidden as shown above in the second picture, but that is highly not recommended.  

## Assembly

The IMU will be mounted over the battery, which could cause shorts. It's recommended to put a piece of electric tape over the part of the battery that is under the IMU, or use liquid electrical tape to insulate the battery from the IMU. The tray also has a modular design that allows wires to be routed either under or over the tray, with cutouts to allow easy access to all the components.
